# Costco receipt parser

A script to turn Costco's json receipt into a csv for further processing.

Costco's printed and online receipts truncate item names for brevity. The full data can be found in the graphql response in the same data that builds the receipt you see online. We can create our own receipt with more context and customization by using the fields which have the full names of items and their metadata.

## How to get your receipt json

This script assumes you have gone through the steps below to get your receipt json.

It cannot fetch this data for you.

For Safari:

1. Open the Web Inspector and inspect the network requests
   - Right click > Inspect Element > Network > XHR/Fetch
2. Sign-in and navigate to https://www.costco.com/OrderStatusCmd
3. Click on the "In-Warehouse" tab
4. Click on the "View Receipt" button
5. Click on the "graphql" document in the inspector
6. Copy/paste the response content into a file, e.g. "receipt.json"

An overall wrapper for:
* Type checking and linting invoked with `mypy` via rules that live inside `.mypy.ini`.
* Formatting invoked via `yapf` via rules that live inside `script/format`.
* Updating usage in the README if the help invocation changes via `script/update-usage.py`

```shell script
$ make format
```

Keeping things tidy.

```shell script
$ make lint
```

Keeping things type-checked and linted.

You may notice that there are multiple `requirements*.txt` files. They are split apart so that the dependencies install easily.

| filename                  | why                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `requirements.txt`        | Common runtime dependencies                  |
| `requirements-dev.txt`    | Development dependencies â€“ mypy, yapf, etc   |
